​[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com) describes itself as a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. In the game, players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.

Within two years after its first release, Axie Infinity grew to become the number one decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain with 1.8 million daily active users and a total transaction volume of more than $2 billion, higher than any NFT project in existence.

Axie Infinity has a 100% player-owned, real money economy. Rather than selling game items or copies, the developers of the game focus on growing the player to player economy and take small fees to monetize. Axies are created by players using in-game resources and sold to new/other players on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com).

The in-game economy revolves around two tokens;

* ​[**AXS**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/axie-infinity) **(Axie Infinity Shards)** - an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe.
* ​[**SLP**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/smooth-love-potion) **(Smooth Love Potion) -** An ERC-20 utility token that can be earned by playing the game. SLP can be used to breed new Axies.

The current in-game activities are the following;

* ​[**Battle**](https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-infinity-community-alpha-guide): In the current battle form, **Axies** can battle against each other to level up and evolve earning SLP after winning battles.
* ​[**Breeding**](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/gameplay/breeding): Players can use SLP to breed new Axies that can later be used in battle or to generate profit on the marketplace.
* ​[**Land**](https://land.axieinfinity.com): Homes and bases for all Axies, which can be upgraded over time using a variety of resources and crafting ingredients. Land owners can create their own games on these land plots.
