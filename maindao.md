# MainDAO

The GAME MainDAO, or ecosystem DAO, is the overarching DAO that has tentacles reaching in every single subDAO under the mainDAO's umbrella. Owning a stake in the ecosystem DAO allows you to vote on the future of each individual subDAO, something that not possible the other way around.

The mechanics behind the GAME DAO can be divided in certain categories. These different objectives and activities are formalized by the early contributors of the GAME DAO and are always open for discussion and adaptation by the governance forum.

GAME DAO takes pride in being decentralized and aims to become autonomous in the initial period of its inception. With every single $GAME token holder holding voting rights to the DAO's decision making process, we ensured a widespread distribution of the token and thereby the voting rights of the DAO.

Our governance model is one of the main activities of the mainDAO and can best be understood by reading the governance section;

The mainDAO governs all the subDAO's that are used in the daily operations. Therefore, one of the main objectives of the mainDAO is to maintain a structured and well organized, profit-generating subDAO. This is mainly done through governance proposals.

In the initial set-up of the GAME DAO, the mainDAO can perform several actions to maintain its subDAO's longevity. The actions consist of, but aren't limited to;

* Constant scaling of subDAOs
* Ensure continuity of subDAOs
* Backstop shortfalls with additional capital within subDAOs
*

For a more elaborate understanding of the subDAO model, please read the subDAO page.

The mainDAO will be the overarching ecosystem DAO that holds a large treasury of precious assets. The goal of the DAO is to ensure the management of this treasury, its longevity and the scaling of its entirety. The current set-up for the mainDAO's treasury will be:

* **Direct claim on all subDAO treasuries (77.5%)** - This means that the mainDAO holds the authority to pull assets from any subDAO immediately.
* **Crypto assets (15%)** - This capital will be used in yield farming strategies and utilized in external protocol governance
* **Cash (ETH + Stablecoins) (5%)** - This capital will be used in flexible (unlocked) yield farms but also function as liquid capital reserve for reinvestment in subDAOs or as reserve to backstop losses in subDAOs.
  * **Note:** subDAO treasuries all hold 10% cash, making the effective cash position of the MainDAO approximately 12.5%
* **NFTs without a DAO (2.5%)** - NFTs that are not subject to a specific subDAO yet or belong to subDAOs (games) that have been phased out will become part of the mainDAO
