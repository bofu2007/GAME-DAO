# GAME DAO - $GAME

The GAME token is the heart of our DAO. Through various inventive ways, we’re giving utility and value to our token. By doing so, we’re ensuring that all contributors to the DAO, whether on a short and long timescale, are incentivized to acquire and retain the GAME token. To best describe what holding our token unlocks, we’ve broken it down into the following categories:

### &#x20;<a href="#governance" id="governance"></a>

Owning a propotional number of GAME token gives the holder a voice about the future of the DAO, be it big or small decision making. While the core contributors to the GAME DAO began with an initial infrastructure and purpose for the organization, the journey ahead is open to change.

Similar to established organizations, the GAME DAO governance forum will be a place where governance members can share their opinion by broadcasting proposals with the other members of the organization. Each token holder can then vote to either accept or reject any proposal. In an aim to satisfy our entire community of gamers, contributors and managers, we’ve ensured a widespread distribution of the GAME token. An example of a proposal could be to vote whether the mainDAO will use treasury funds to ensure a soft floor price for the GAME token through either buy-back mechanism or burns.

At inception, the governance structure will be implemented based on the battle-tested OpenZeppelin’s Governor contract. We will use Tally as a full-fledged application for on-chain governance, which consists of a voting dashboard, proposal wizard and real time analysis. Our governor contracts are compatible with Tally and implemented at the DAO launch.

More information regarding the exact logistics of the DAO and its governance can be found on this page.

GAME DAO is a DAO that consists of many different subDAOs. Each subDAO represents our operations in a specific play-to-earn game. At this point, we have one subDAO for Axie Infinity, home to over 1,000 scholars; one subDAO for Bigtime with over 1,000 scholars and one for Thetan Arena with over 500; one subDAO for Skyweaver with over 100 scholars. This is generating a large return on investment for our DAO, contributing to the mainDAO. Then, the mainDAO will have the ability to branch into new games, acquire more NFTs, embrace yield farming strategies and other ways of generating profit.

Since we’re focused solely on play-to-earn gaming, by owning a piece of the GAME token, you get to participate in dozens of play-to-earn games and precious NFTs. Betting on GAME DAO is betting on the play-to-earn industry to increase in value and size over time. The more profit each subDAO generates, the more our mainDAO can do.

After deploying our GAME token into the blockchain, we’ll give you the chance to stake your tokens. We have set aside a substantial amount of tokens in rewards for staking, but this is just a fraction of the rewards you can receive by staking the GAME token.

GAME DAO is at the forefront of the play-to-earn industry partnering with multiple games. Through these partnerships, we’ll have the ability to offer exclusive in-game rewards and early access to these games among other exciting structures. Besides that, we aim to provide our token holders with early access to NFT drops from our partners, but also from GAME DAO itself.

Please note that the breakdown of the token mentioned above is based on the initial set-up of our DAO. There will most likely be more uses in future as our DAO progresses and branches into more areas.
