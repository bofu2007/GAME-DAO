# DAO structure

GAME DAO is a decentralized Autonomous Organization. This indicates that no central party holds full authority over the organization. In order to create a sustainable organization, the DAO is structured in a way to stimulate growth, decentralized decision making and treasury conservation.

The GAME DAO has a wide variety of operations across multiple games. Therefore, our DAO consists of multiple layers, best displayed in the image below.

Beneath you can find a general overview of the different elements of the GAME DAO structure.

The MainDAO, or ecosystem DAO, is the grand instrument that has the ability to pull the strings in all GAME DAO's operations. In short, the MainDAO's objectives consist of the following;

* Ensure scaling and continuity of subDAOs
* Provide soft floor price to $GAME token price
* Generate yield farming income
* Provide additional capital to subDAOs
* Governance of the GAME DAO future
* Backstop shortfalls within subDAOs

For a detailed description how our MainDAO is constructed please follow the link beneath.

The subDAOs are the DAO's specified per game. Every single game GAME DAO operates in will have their own DAO governed by the ecosystem DAO. In short, the subDAOs objectives consist of the following;

* Ensure continuity and scaling of different in-game strategies
* Maximize earnings from strategies
* Grow collection of top-tier NFTs with positive value accrual expectancy.

The vaults represent the different strategies a subDAO can deploy to generate revenue. The profits that vaults make flow back to the different stakeholders in the ecosystem. An example of a flow profit generated by a certain vault;

* Gamers/Scholars receive 90% of generated profit
*
* Managers/Operators receive 10%
