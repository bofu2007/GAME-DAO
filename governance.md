# Governance

GAME DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, meaning there's no central entity making decisions. Decision making is done through voting by the stakeholders who own the GAME token. In this section, we describe how stakeholders can make proposals and vote on these.

The GAME token was created to decentralize the management and development of GAME DAO's DAO, investments and platform.

More information about the GAME token can be found [here](broken-reference).

Similar to what we've seen with other successful DAO's like Yearn Finance, our decision making process will occur through a Governance forum. In this forum, individuals can start a proposal which shall be voted on by the other GAME token holders.

An example of a proposal is the following:

_Proposal to redeem the liquid (crypto-assets and liquid NFTs) part of the treasury when $GAME market cap is below the treasury value of the DAO. This is akin to a company trading below book value. Liquid part of treasury could be used to buy back GAME tokens, to use as (locked) distribution to stakers or to be burned. This effectively creates a soft floor for the GAME token._
